## Basket App

### Completed

- some tests
- Store.js exposed via StoreContext
- some until function for formatting, mapping objects using native map/filter/reduce instead of lodash
- React hooks of useContext, useReducer, useState
- accessing data from Store state or passing calculation as props

### Notes / to be done

- styling (JSS)
- actions folder with plain redux objects to be consumed by dispatch?
- redux middleware, e.g thunk?
- simplify utils, and check whether are pure functions
- refactor to useSelector / useDispatch React Redux hooks
- presentational components to be reusable containers with children props passed to them?
- more tests
